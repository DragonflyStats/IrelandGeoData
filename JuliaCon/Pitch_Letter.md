Hi there XXX

New Year’s very often bring new changes but in this instance  I am, once again, the Social Media Chair for JuliaCon 2021.

Both JuliaCon, and the Julia Community in general, had a very strong year last year, and we expect 2021 to be better again. JuliaCon 2020 was held virtually last July, with no registration charge. The event attracted more than 10,000 registrations, a notable achievement that generated a great deal of interest in the wider tech community.

This increase in interest was evident in the spike of activity in the Julia Language Youtube channel [1]. Of course, this was also due to the broadcast of the "Introduction to Computational Thinking"[2], which introduced Julia to a wider community. I have attached some additional graphics to this email.

JuliaCon 2021 has already generated a lot of interest(massive buzz?). The event page on LinkedIn [3] has attracted more than 5,000 registration (as of Wednesday 3rd February 2021), with nealy six months to go before the conference. We expect that figure to grow substantially between now and then.

We are currently pulling together our programme for the event which will be held later in the year (when exactly?) and we are approaching organisations and individuals to work with us to provide a full conference packed with new ideas and fun. I’ve attached some details around sponsorship packages. These are limited so if you are keen it would be great for you to let us know as soon as possible.

Really looking forward to a great JuliaCon 2021 and hopefully working with you as well.
