Hi there XXX

Happy new year. I hope you dont mind me reaching out to you on behalf of JuliaCon 2020.
I am the Social Media Chair again.

The matter in question is reaching out to companies who would potentially sponsor JuliaCon 2020.
I have attached the brochure to this email.

Both JuliaCon, and the Julia Community in general, had a very strong year last year, and we expect 2021 to be better again.
JuliaCon 2020 was held virtually last July, with no registration charge. 
The event attracted more than 10,000 registrations, a notable achievement that generated more interest in the wider tech 
community after thee event was over.

This increase in interest was evident in the spike of activity in the Julia Language Youtube channel [1].
Of course, this was also due to the broadcast of the "Introduction to Computational Thinking"[2], which introduced Julia to 
a wider community. 
I have attached some additional graphics to this email.

JuliaCon 2021 has alread generated a lot of interest. The event page on LinkedIn [3] has attracted more than 5,000 registration (as of Wednesday 3rd February 2021), with nealy six months to 
go before the conference. We expect that figure to grow substantially between now and then.
