'What did you write?' Emily asked. 'That I am disgusted with their behaviour, and that if the firing does not cease immediately, I shall leave the town tonight.' In the streets there was chaos.

The moonlight lit the scene; turning dirty white robes spotless, illuminating the open-mouthed, wailing women who in grief had let their veils fall. The red flashes of fire from beyond the walls gave a look of some bizarre firework night. 
It took an hour or two before the gunfire, stammered, hiccuped, stopped, and shortly afterwards Mahmoud, dignity intact, returned, bowed low to his master and said : 'It is done, praise be to God.' `And those outside can stay there,' said the Shereef. The gunfire ceased but the wailing went On all night. An Arab woman's grief is a very vocal thing.

But he seemed content to stay in Tangier, enjoying the hospitality of the Wazannis. The Shereef himself was doing nothing to speed events. He had not forgiven the French for thwarting his intention of visiting Europe and had decided that they could now wait for him. He had complete confidence that Si Sliman would not break his word. For the Europeans the same trust did not come so easily. The power of the Shereef over Si Sliman had admittedly been proved, but they did not appreciate just how much the Shereef's word was law and how a promise given to him by a Moslem was like a promise given to God. So the situation hung in abeyance as the summer's heat made Tangier a somnambulant town. The Shereef amused his wife; attending to her comfort and helping her plan their new home. He lingered quite deliberately and when-ever he received another and more impatient request for the mission to be completed made various excuses. His wife was not well. The house was not ready. He was required on his own personal business in Tangier. But the real reason for the delay was Emily. He was more in love with her every day and could not bear to leave her. She was unaware of the extent of his procrastinations and had actually been encouraging him to finish the Si Sliman business. She felt that her husband was not entirely proud of himself for having broken Si Sliman and once he was delivered to the Sultan that would be the end of the matter and the Shereef could then relax. Emily was therefore upset to receive a letter from the French Government couched in as tactful terms as possible, but asking her not to stand in the way of the completion of the mission, and when she showed the Shereef the letter, he exploded that they dare blame her.

Emily said with pride that most of the men of Tangier had received their first bath at her hands, but it was in 876, when she was twenty-six years old, a vital, athletic girl with the bright hair that so fascinated her husband, that she started to give instruction to the Moorish ladies. She taught them basic and rudimentary hygiene. 
She made them wash their baby's bottles, insisted that the children were weaned at the proper time, instead of the usual custom of breast-feeding until the child was well over a year old. She un-doubtedly saved many lives as the infant mortality rate was very high in Morocco then. Her clinic began almost immediately after the birth of Moulay Ahmed and when they had moved into their new house. She had exchanged a Zowia for an emergency ward! Her biggest problem was that the people had almost too much faith in her medical abilities. They would bring children suffering with hernias, ophthalmia, dysentery and malnutrition. They could not afford the European doctors of the town; their native methods were USUally nauseating forms of magic, which sometimes worked by sheer falth. but more often did not. And besides, once it was decided by the people that the Shereef had passed some of his baraka to his wife, her services Were more in demand than ever. Quite shamelessly, she cajoled the local doctors into
