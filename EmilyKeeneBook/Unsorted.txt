John Varley, Cromwell Fleetwood's uncle, was one of the great painters and art teachers of the day. Turner had been his pupil, and there were stories of wild dinner parties where Mrs. John Varley was thrown across the table from guest to guest. As a family they were caught up in the current obsession with spiritualism and astrology. 


Ellen Varley was different from the family she had mar-ried into. A Miss Rouse, her father was a gentleman from Hampstead. 
She was remarkably good-looking with red hair and a naturally aristocratic manner. in later years her family referred to her as Queen Elizabeth behind her back and there was a distinct resemblance. She married Crom-well Fleetwood (named after two of his ancestors, Oliver Cromwell, and Admiral Fleetwood) in October 1855, when she was just eighteen and he was twenty-seven. 

She bore him four children. The young Ellen Varley was gay and luxury loving. Perhaps her husband had inherited a Puritan streak, for as the years went by he became more and more engrossed in his work, while she became increas-ingly bored. Then, early in 1871, Mrs. Varley went to Malvern to take the waters for her health. There she met the gentleman from Trenton, NewJersey, named Ion Perdicaris. The Perdicaris family had contributed considerable money to the Southern cause in the American Civil War. Ion's father, George A. Perdicaris, had been a Greek refugee and arrived in America under sentence of death from the Greek Government. For some time he had taught his own Ian-

But whatever the truth of the matter, not the background to the Perdicaris affair was never discussed in front of the children of the Keene household. Emily's younger sister, Helena Winifred, who, many years later was to live for seven years in Tangier, wrote, not long before her death, a short history of her sister. She describes very briefly and in the circumstances, inicon" elusively, the events which lead up to Emily's arrival in Tangier. 
`She (Emily) was the eldest of eleven (eight of whom lived) children and our parents were very Victorian. My mother had a lovely voice and a favourite song -was called The Moorish Bride. I still have it copied out in her hand, and I wonder if this in any way influenced my sister's choice of husband. She was a high-spirited girl, clever and rather difficult to manage. She hated the perpetual nursery atmosphere of the home, and begged to be allowed to go to boarding school in London. Here she did well and was very popular with teachers and pupils. 'One day a new girl arrived, a very homesick little person, and my sister took her under her wing. This led to a lifelong friendship, and was really the foundation of Emily's romantic adventures. `I 'he grateful child begged her mother to invite Emily to their home for the holidays and she became a constant and very welcome guest. k: years passed by and on one of these visits her hostess Was dangerously ill.

The Sultan needed his assistance and goodwill for the same reasons, but resent-fully for it was well known that the Grand Shereef had European leanings. Should he throw in his lot completely with the French it could bode little good for Morocco's independence in the future. History European history—has categorised Sidi Hadj Abdeslam as a collaborator. This he was, but he was also apatriot who thought. He believed in the European methods of progression, and wanted the more advanced countries of the world to be permitted to trade, open bus-inesses and put money into Morocco. He wanted his country to step into the nineteenth century and was intel-ligent and politically minded enough to know that if Morocco was ruled and run in the way it was at present the eventual end must be annexation by a foreign power. He did not think that this in itself was a bad thing. But it was not possible to explain these views to a feudal ruler whose one intention Ivas to keep out the Christians. Men-tion of the subject would be enough to cast suspicion on himself as preparing the country for the Christians to take over. And how much more suspicion would he incur when he married that girl with the magnificent hair he won-dered? For he was determined to do so. At the time he met Emily Keene he was out of favour with the court. He preferred life in Europeanised Tangier than in feudal Morocco City (Marrakesh) or Fez where the Sultan resided. He was tired of being an object of suspicion to his own people and a pawn in the power game the French were playing. He had made up his mind to live somewhere out of Morocco,probably France, and settle down with a European wife. The Sultan, Sidi Mu hammed was well aware of these

Crossing water, particularly in the winter and spring months meant every-one was liable to end up on the further shore wet through. And Idien it did rain in Northern Morocco the water fell in torrents. Wet or dry, by night the open county-side became very cold. Though the actual journeying over fields, mountains and 'bled' (desert) was difficult, the enormous tents which accommodated everyone were more comfortable and clean than the average Moroccan house. Layers of carpets were carried to cover the ground under the tents (Europeans took camp beds) plus a great deal of bed-ding and hangings to make the tents more homelike inside and to keep out draughts. Once the tents were pitched, a high standard of luxury resulted, as Emily found out on her first tr. ip from Tangier to Tetuan, Cueta and on to Gibraltar.
