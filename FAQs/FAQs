#### Why do I need to write an FAQ section?
I absolutely need an FAQ section because I cant go anywhere without being asked these questions. 
Just the other day, I was down in Tescos supermarket when a staff member walked up to me and asked me what my favourite R package was.
I didn't even make it to the check-out before some staff member asked me where in the world I was based.
That question was slightly unexpected as he lives a few doors down from me. 
Nonetheless, my public has a right to know, and I will not leave them wanting for answers.

#### How come I know so many Supermarket workers. 
By the standards of the quiet suburb that I live in, well stocked with children and small yappy dogs, being on a conversational 
basis with three or more retail workers constitutes a hectic social life. 
Also I am type of customer that arrives in at ten minutes before closing time, and proceeds to casually amble from aisle to aisle prevaricating over 
what I am in the mood for at that particular moment. That sort of behaviour tends to stick in the mind of retail staff coming to the end of their shift.

#### Am I a Python Genius?
Not even remotely. My knowledge of Python is fairly confined to NumPy, pandas and scikit learn. 
I know a reasonable amount about graphics packages too, but I dont use them often.
Fundamentally I am a mathematician/statistician, and not a developer in the conventional sense.

#### Am I a dog person or a cat person?
Honestly I am a dog person, but I get on very well with most cats. 
My neighbour's cat loves visiting my house, sometimes to assess the quality of my cooking, other times with a view to injuring me.

#### Where I am in the Language Wars?
SQL. Not enough people know about SQL and database servers (including me). Leaving SQL aside, there is an abundance of opinions on why one is better than another. Some make good points.
When you pose the questiont to someone who really knows the area - you would get very non-committal answers as to what language is best. Nearly ever answer is qualified
by the language being best for a particular use case. 
Dont do language wars, folks. It is a waste of your time, and you never make yourself look good in the long run.

#### Why did I start Dragonfly Statistics.
The truth is that it started off as a fake company that I put in my LinkedIn profile to make myself 
look better, adding a bit of start-up hipster chic to what is otherwise a very incoherent career history.
After a while, it turned into a real corporate entity, with Tax and VAT and accountancy fees.
I never earned enough to leave off it alone.
