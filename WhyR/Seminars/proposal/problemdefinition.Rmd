# The Problem

The Why R? foundation is based in Poland, but has collaborators all across Europe and Africa (This geographic constraint is fundamentally due to similar time zones.) The foundation has run a series of pre-meetings since 2016 and a webinar series since April 2020. There have been 16 webinars to date. The ambition of Why R? is to use proceeds of conferences and pre-meetings to support R community events around the world. Why R? will seek to build strong sponsor relations to strengthen its ability to provide fiscal support.

Webinars usually take place on Thursday at 6pm UTC, evening time in Europe and Africa. We find that more people watch the recordings that are available online than the live stream. In accordance with best community standards, we try to invite speakers from a broad spectrum of backgrounds, and to highlight the work of RLadies.
