# The Problem

There are many stories about the history of R and its precursor S. The purpose of this proposal is to understand the differences between S and R by reading, collating, and summarising materials related to this and making it easy for everyone to access. Interviews with people who worked on both languages may help clarify some materials.

We will bring together these resources and make them easily accesible.
