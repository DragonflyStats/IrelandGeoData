# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People

This work will be completed by the team at Why R foundation, some of whom are already actively working on the project.

<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?

## Processes
We have a COC that has worked since we started in 2016 and we will continue to use. We anticipate having meetings every 2 months about progress and quarterly ISC meetings.

<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

## Payments

Payments will be processed by the Why R? Foundation, but can be processed by the R consortium if preferable.
Payments will be made on the basis of professional services. Presenters are responsible for their own tax affairs. 
Payments will be made to each presenter and travel expenses will not be funded.

<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
