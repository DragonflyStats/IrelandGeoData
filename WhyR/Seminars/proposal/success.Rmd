# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done

We define success as having educated the R community about the differences between R and S. 

<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

## Measuring success

We will measure this by the outputs that we have made freely available to the R Community. We will summarize information and make it available to all.

<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

## Future work

After this work other chapters of this research could include Prior to RCore, initial packages developed, RFoundation, CRAN, and RConsortium. 


<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

## Key risks

We are hopeful that the authors of S, R, and the authors of relevant books are willing to speak with us.
