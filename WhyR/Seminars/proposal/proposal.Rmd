# The proposal

## Overview

The goal of this project is support the continuation of the Why R? webinar series.

## Detail
The Why R? foundation proposes to create a panel of presenters to present weekly webinars. This panel will be drawn from under-represented minorities and called the Funded Presenter Panel. It will consist of four or five people appointed by the Why R? foundation, and approved by the R consortium.

The proposal envisages the production of 20 one-hour webinars as part of this programme (i.e. a pilot programme). The project will be considered completed when 20 webinars have been made under the terms of reference. By mutual agreement, Why R? foundation and the R consortium may agree to continue the project, i.e. an increased number of webinars. While this proposal envisages one presenter per webinar, we will agree to have two presenters, if preferred by the R consortium. (This will change the budget accordingly.) We would like to include webinars that have taken place since 3rd September 2020 in this programme. (Constructively this means a payment to Lais Carvalho for her excellent hosting of two webinars)
