# The proposal

## Overview

This project will outline the differences between S and R to the R community.

## Detail
Before any work commences we will develop a code of conduct, find new members, and confirm the ownership of all intellectual property. We would like new members who study the history of computing as guides for this research, since we are coders and statisticians.

Once this is complete, we will seperate into groups to read and summarise relevant material. If any group needs more clarification we may interview some of the original authors for clarification. Once completed, we will make summaries available to the public.
