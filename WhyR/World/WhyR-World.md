Why R? World

This proposal seeks the creation of a series of short videos featuring the R community around the world.


#### Curatorial Policy

* In contrast to other projects (e.g. Why R? Webinars) this series would feature the role and experiences of career-young R users around the world.
* The videos/ interviews would explore the lived experience of being an R user (i.e. the featured guest or guests) in various locations around the world.
* The curatorial policy shall favour a broad spectrums of locations from all continents of the world, and a broad series of subjects areas, particularly regions not typically represented in the R community. 



* Technical content will not be typically featured.
* In some cases, the guest may not be an R user, but the content aligns with the curatorial direction of the overall Why R? World project. Examples would include
 - an episode on conservation activities on South Atlantic Islands and/or Antarctica
 - an episode on the Transgender Day or Remembrance Events - organized by Cardiff RUG)

#### Techical Details

* Sets of videos will be released periodlically as a "season"
* Each season of the series will be contain about 10-12 videos.
* The videos will be approximately 15 minutes long.
* The videos will be recorded asynchronously (i.e. not livestreamed)

#### Presenters


#### Legacy

* By creating these videos, we hope that R commmunity members from all around the world would feel encouraged to develop full length talks, with technical content, for future R conferences.
* Why R? and R Consortium would consolidate their positions as strong global brands.
