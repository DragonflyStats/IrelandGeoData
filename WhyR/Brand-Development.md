* JuliaCon is managed by the JuliaCon committee, which operates on a permanent basis.
* This is beneficial for retaining institutional capabability for critical processes, and beneficial to the long-term viability of the conference series.
* Critical processes are processes that are vital to the long-term viability of the Conference Series. Failure to manage critical processes can undermine the viability of the conference series.
* Critical processes relevant here would include Website, Publicity & Social Media and Sponsorship.


#### Social Media

* Brand development, through social media, is the primary mechanism for attracting potential sponsors and attracting speakers.
* The key platforms are LinkedIn (Sponsors) and Twitter (Speakers).
* As much as is reasonably possible, digital assets should be maintained on an ongoing basis and just rebranded periodically. 
 - It is not advisable to create new digital assets (i.e. set up a new page) for each interation of the conference.
* You should try and build up a follower base over several years. It takes a long time to build up a LinkedIn following.

#### Website

* The Website should be published as soon as possible, with as much detail as possible.
* A code of Conduct should be presented prominently on the website. On an increasingly common basis, this is a requirement for sponsorship contracts. 
* To determine the value of the conference brand, potential sponsors will look at who has sponsored the conferences in the past. Try to make this information accessible.
