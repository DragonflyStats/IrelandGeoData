## Why R? Webinars - Funded Presenter Panel 
* Why R? Foundation propose to create a panel of presenters to present weekly webinars. 
* This panel will be drawn from under-represented minorities.
* In this document the panel shall be called the Funded Presenter Panel.
* Appointment to the Funded Presenter Panel shall be made by Why R? foundation. Each appointment must be approved by the R consortium.


#### About Why R?

* The Why R? foundation is based in Poland, but has collaborators all across Europe and Africa (This geographic constraint is fundamentally due to similar time zones.)
* Why R? foundation have ran a series of pre-meetings since 2016 (see map)
* The Why R? webinar series has been running since April 2020. There has been 16 webinars to date.
* The ambition of Why R? is to use proceeds of the conferences and pre-meetings to support R community events around the world.
* Why R? will seek to build strong sponsor relations to strengten its ability to provide fiscal support. 

#### The Why R? Webinar Series

* Webinars typically take place on Thursday at 6pm UTC. This corresponds to evening time in Europe and Africa.
* Recordings are available online. We find that more people watch the recordings that the live-stream.
* In accordance with best community standards, we try to invite speakers from a broad spectrum of backgrounds, and to highlight the work of RLadies.

#### Duration of the project.
* The proposal envisages the production of 20 one-hour webinars as part of this program (i.e. a pilot programme)
* The project will be considered completed when 20 webinars have been made under the terms of reference.
* By mutual agreement, Why R? foundation and the R consortium may agree to continue the project, i.e. an increased number of webinars.
* While this proposal envisages one presenter per webinar, we will agree to have two presenters, if preferred by the R consortium.
* If possible, we would like to include webinars that have taken place since 3rd September 2020 in this programme. (Constructively this means a payment to Lais Carvalho for her excellent hosting of two webinars)

####  Duties and Renumeration of the Funded Panel Presenters

* A payment for the presenter for each webinar - EUR 150. This will be
* The duties of the presenter are to 
 1) Research the topic and prepare questions for the interview
 2) Take part in a test recording ("a sound check") in advance of the scheduled webinar
 3) Present the webinar, by introducing the speaker, and afterwards, leading the Questions and Answer session.
 4) Assisting in the promotion of the event on Social Media.
 
* Payments will be made on the basis of professional services. Presenters are responsible for their own tax affairs.
* Payments will be made to each presenter
* Travel expenses will not be funded.


#### Benefit to the R community
* The fundamental principle behind this proposal is "Representation Matters". 
* The visibility of members of under-represented minorities in positions of responsibility and leadership would be encouraging to under-represented minorities to engage in the R community (i.e. giving talks, co-organizing community events etc).

#### Protocol for possible scenarios
* Webinars that take place during the period , but that do not presented by a member of the Funded Presenter Panel, shall not be counted as part of agreed number of productions.
* This situation may arise no member of the Funded Presenter Panel are available on the date of particular recording (e.g. they have been engaged for similar work by other R conferences).

#### Promotion of the R Consortium Brand

* For the duration of the project, R consortium branding will appear on all webinar productions (including ones that are not presented by members of the funded presenter panel).
